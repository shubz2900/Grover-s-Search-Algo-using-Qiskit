# Grover-s-Search-Algo-using-Qiskit
Grover search is one of the most popular algorithms used for searching a solution among many possible candidates using Quantum Computers. If there are N possible solutions among which there is exactly one solution, then Grover search can be used to find the solution with O(sqrt(N)) function evaluations.
